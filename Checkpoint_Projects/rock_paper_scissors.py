This script allows the user to play the classic game Rock, Paper Scissors
There is also a variant included called Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.
This variant has been made popular through the "The Big Bang Theory".

This script is part of my (@milakim) Cod√©dex checkpoint project of the beginner Python course.
